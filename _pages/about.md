[Intelligent Warehouse Robot for Classifying, Sorting, and Transporting Goods‚Äô Boxes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10905340)

**Ziyuan Zhao**, Amna Mazen, Youssef Bazzi<sup>*</sup>, Bingyi Wang, Sushuang Li

- This paper presents an integrated intelligent warehouse robot system that combines computer vision, robotic manipulation, and autonomous navigation to perform box classification, sorting, and transportation. Using YOLOv5 and a Kinect camera, the system classifies boxes by size, while a WidowX robotic arm handles pick-and-place operations and a Pioneer P3-DX mobile robot with LiDAR navigates to designated storage areas. Experimental results in a simulated warehouse demonstrate reliable detection, obstacle avoidance, and precise placement, showing the system‚Äôs potential to improve warehouse efficiency and automation.

[Simulation analysis of spatial electromagnetic field of transformer core considering nonlinear B-H curve](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10076147)

Xianwei Guo, Zhetao Huang, **Ziyuan Zhao<sup>*</sup>**

- This paper investigates the spatial electromagnetic field distribution of a transformer core considering the nonlinear B-H curve using a COMSOL-based E-type transformer model. The results show that magnetic saturation causes strong nonlinear field concentration in the central core, leading to excessive losses, current distortion, and rapid output current reduction, which may damage the transformer.

[Research on preparation process of ethanol and C4 olefin based on linear and nonlinear regression fitting algorithm](https://clausiuspress.com/article/2206.html)

Xianwei Guo, Zhetao Huang, **Ziyuan Zhao<sup>*</sup>**

- This paper studies ethanol-to-C4 olefin preparation by analyzing the effects of catalyst combinations and temperature on conversion and selectivity. Linear and nonlinear regression models solved with MATLAB and SPSS reveal functional relationships, enabling trend prediction and offering insights for catalyst-driven chemical processes.
